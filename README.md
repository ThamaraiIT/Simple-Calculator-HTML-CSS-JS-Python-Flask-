# 🧮 Simple Calculator (HTML, CSS, JS, Python/Flask)

## 📘 Objective
The goal of this project is to build a **minimal, web-based calculator** using modern web technologies — **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the user interface, and **Python (Flask)** for backend processing.  
Users can perform basic arithmetic operations such as **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** directly from their browser.

This project demonstrates:
- Integration of a **JavaScript frontend** with a **Python Flask backend** using REST APIs.  
- **Clean Flask application structure** and separation of concerns between frontend and backend.
